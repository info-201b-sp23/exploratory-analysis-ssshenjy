# Overview ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Assignment 1
# You will answer the following questions and more by completing the code below:
# - What were the most attended and least attended protests in the US in the
#   last 5 years?
# - How many protests occurred in Washington state?
# - How did protests in 2019 compare to 2020, and why?
# - What are the biggest reasons people are protesting in the US?
# For each question/prompt, write the necessary code to get the answer. Each
# question is worth 2 points.
# You will store most of your answers in the variable names listed with the
# questions in `backtics`.
# There are 4 prompts marked `Reflection`. Be sure to write your responses to
# these questions in the `README.md` file.
# NOTE: We recommend that you turn on "Soft Wrap Long Lines" to work with this
# file so you can read the instructions more easily.
# Part 1: Set up (12 points) ---------------------------------------------------
# In this section, you will load the CountLove data and necessary packages.
# (1.a) Load the `stringr` package, which you will use later.
library(stringr)
# (1.b) Load the data from CountLove by using the following URL:
# https://countlove.org/data/data.csv
# Save this dataframe into a variable called `protest_data`
url <- "https://countlove.org/data/data.csv"
protest_data <- read_csv(url)
#  Whenever we load data, the first thing we want to do is manually examine it,
# see how it looks, and make sure we understand what each column (or feature)
# and each row (or record) in the dataset means.
# Open the dataframe by clicking the spreadsheet icon in the Environment or by
# using View(). Manually examine the data by scrolling through it.
View(protest_data)
# (1.c) Without using code, look at all the the column names in the dataset, and
# then type each column name in the comment below, with each column name
# separated by a comma.
# Column 1, Column 2, Column 3...
# Data, Location, Attendees, Event, Tags, Curated, Source, Total Articles
# (1.d) Without using code, pick one row in the dataset (any row!), and then
# type in all the values from that row, with each value separated by a comma.
# For ex: 2018-01-01, University of Washington, Seattle, WA...
# 2017-01-16, Johnson City, TN, 300, Civil Rights, Civil Rights; For racial justice; Martin Luther King, Jr., Yes, http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/Local/2017/01/16/Hundreds-march-to-honor-Martin-Luther-King-Jr-in-Johnson-City.html?ci=featured&lp=46&ti=
#, 4
# (1.e) How many protests are recorded in the dataset in total? Use an R
# function to determine this number and then save it in a variable called
# `num_protests`
# Hint: This is the same number as the number of rows in the dataset!
num_protests <- nrow(protest_data)
cat("The total number of protests recorded in the dataset is", num_protests, ".\n")
# (1.f) How many features (or columns) are recorded for each protest? It's

# Save the number of features for each protest in a variable called
# `num_features`
num_features <- ncol(protest_data)

## Part 2: Attendees (12 points) -----------------------------------------------
# In this part, you will explore the number of people who participated in the protests
# (2.a) Extract the `Attendees` column into a variable called `num_attendees`

# Hint: Remember to exclude NA values when using the functions below!
# (2.c) What is the greatest number of attendees at a protest?
# Save the number of protests in a variable called `max_attendees`
max_attendees <- max(num_attendees, na.rm = T)
# 725000
# (2.d) What is the average (mean) number of attendees at a protest?
# Save the number of protests in a variable called `mean_attendees`
mean_attendees <- mean(num_attendees, na.rm = T)
mean_attendees <- round(mean_attendees, digits = 0)

# (2.e) What is the median number of attendees?
# Save the number of protests in a variable called `median_attendees`
# Median is 100 attendes
median_attendees <- median(num_attendees, na.rm = T)
# (2.f) What is the difference between the mean and median number of attendees?
# Subtract median_attendees from mean_attendees
# Save the difference in a variable called `difference_attendees`
difference_atendees <- mean_attendees - median_attendees
# Reflection 1 (answer in the README.md file)
# Why do you think the mean is higher than the median? Which metric would you
# use in a report about this data, and why?

num_locations <- length(unique(locations))

# (3.c) How many protests occurred in the state of Washington?
# Use a function from the stringr package to detect the letters "WA" in the
library(stringr)
# Location column and filter to only keep WA locations
# Then, calculate the number of protests recorded in Washington
# Save the NUMBER of WA locations in a variable called `num_in_wa`
num_in_wa <- sum(str_detect(locations, "WA"))
# (3.d) What proportion of protests occurred in Washington?

This table offers an comprehensive review of relevant aggregated data of the U.S. as a whole regarding the COVID-19 vaccination status and statistics for its latest day of record. Information included in the table are average total doses administered which indicates the overall volume of vaccinations, average number of people fully vaccinated which provides an insight of the progress of vaccination coverage for full immunization, and average shared doses used which examinates the efficiency of vaccine distribution and utilization. This table provides a snapshot of the average statistics, grouping by all states of the United States on the latest available date, to monitor the progress of vaccination efforts and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns.
